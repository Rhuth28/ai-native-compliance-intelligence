# Request Information Guidelines

Request additional information when the risk is ambiguous and more context can reduce uncertainty.
Examples:
- Verify recent profile changes (email, phone, address)
- Confirm device ownership and recent login attempts
- Confirm relationship to new counterparty

If the user confirms legitimacy, continue monitoring rather than escalating.
