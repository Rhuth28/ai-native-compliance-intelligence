# Escalation Guidelines

Escalate a case when there are multiple corroborating risk signals suggesting account takeover, fraud, or money movement risk.
Escalate immediately if there is:
- New device login combined with recent profile change
- Large transfer to a new counterparty/recipient within 24 hours of a profile change
- Multiple unusual events in a short time window (usually within the past 30 days)

Do not take enforcement actions automatically. Enforcement actions require human review and approval.
